# Music-Recommendation-System-Using-NLP
Music Recommendation System Using NLP

## Overview
This project implements a song recommendation system based on textual data using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The system analyzes song lyrics to recommend similar songs to users.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- NLTK

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
2. Install dependencies:

## Usage
1. Prepare your song data in CSV format with columns including 'song', 'text', and 'link'.
2. Place your CSV file in the project directory.
3. Update the file path in the script (`spotify_millsongdata.csv`) to match your data file.
4. Run the script:

5. Input the song name for which you want recommendations.
6. Receive recommendations based on textual similarity between songs.

## File Descriptions
- `song_recommendation.py`: Main script implementing the recommendation system.
- `spotify_millsongdata.csv`: Sample dataset containing song information.
- `README.md`: Project documentation.
- `requirements.txt`: List of Python dependencies.

## Data Preprocessing
- The script performs text cleaning and preprocessing on the song lyrics, including lowercasing, removing special characters, tokenization, and stemming.

## Model Training
- The system utilizes TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity to compute the similarity between songs based on their lyrics.

## Recommendations
- Given a song name, the system provides a list of recommended songs that are most similar in terms of their textual content.

## Serialization
- The similarity matrix and DataFrame are serialized using pickle for faster retrieval during recommendation.

## Future Improvements
- Incorporate additional features such as song metadata (artist, genre) for better recommendation accuracy.
- Experiment with different NLP techniques and algorithms to improve performance.
- Develop a user interface for easier interaction with the recommendation system.
